# LowPower_Sparkfun_NRF52832
## Overview
Porting over the wonderful work of Forward Computing to bring low power functionalilty to the SparkFun NRF52832 breakout board via the Arduino IDE. This repo essentially 
equips the Sparkfun NRF52832 board definition with the extra files necessary to allow the Sparkfun NRF52832 breakout board to be programmed with the 
![examples provided by Forward Computing](https://www.forward.com.au/pfod/BLE/LowPower/index.html).

## Installation
To utilize this repo, simply: 
- install the "Sparkfun NRF52832 boards" board definitions by following ![these instructions](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/nrf52832-breakout-board-hookup-guide)
- download this repository to your computer
- copy the "hardware" and "tools" directories into the directory where your Arduino IDE stores preferences.txt

## Appologies 
This is quite a messy way to upload such changes. Credit is due certainly to Sparkfun, Forward Computing, and Sandeepmisty for their work that these changes build on.
